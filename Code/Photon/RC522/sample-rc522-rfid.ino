/* FILE:    RC522_RFID_Module_Example
   DATE:    23/03/14
   VERSION: 0.2.1 Spark

REVISIONS:

29/08/16    Version 0.2.1, modified by ScruffR: corrected Software SPI sample

23/03/14    Version 0.2, modified by Paul Kourany to run on Spark Core
            with added support for Software SPI
24/07/13    Created version 0.1


This is an example of how to use the RC522 RFID module. The module allows reading
and writing to various types of RFID devices and can be found in our MFRC-522 
(HCMODU0016) and Ultimate RFID (HCARDU0068) kits. This example Arduino sketch uses
the RFID library written by Miguel Balboa to read the pre-programmed serial number 
from RFID cards and tags supplied with our RFID kits. Snapshots and links to the 
library are available on our support forum.
